# Embedded Structs

Go is not an [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) language. However, embedded structs provide a kind of _data-only_ inheritance that can be useful at times. Keep in mind, Go doesn't support classes or inheritance in the _complete_ sense, but embedded structs are a way to elevate and **share fields between struct definitions.**

```go
type car struct {
  brand string
  model string
}

type truck struct {
  // "car" is embedded, so the definition of a
  // "truck" now also additionally contains all
  // of the fields of the car struct
  car
  bedSize int
}
```

## Embedded vs. Nested

- Unlike nested structs, an embedded struct's fields are accessed at the top level like normal fields.
- Like nested structs, you assign the promoted fields with the embedded struct in a [composite literal](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Composite_literals).

```go
lanesTruck := truck{
  bedSize: 10,
  car: car{
    brand: "Toyota",
    model: "Tundra",
  },
}

fmt.Println(lanesTruck.brand) // Toyota
fmt.Println(lanesTruck.model) // Tundra
```

In the example above you can see that both `brand` and `model` are accessible from the top-level, while the nested equivalent to this object would require you to access these fields via a nested `car` struct: `lanesTruck.car.brand` or `lanesTruck.car.model`.

## Assignment

At Textio, a "user" struct represents an account holder, and a "sender" is just a "user" with some additional "sender" specific data. A "sender" is a user that has a `rateLimit` field that tells us how many messages they are allowed to send.

Fix the bug by embedding the proper struct in the other.
